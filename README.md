# Football Team Card

## Description
The **Football Team Card** is a dynamic web application designed to display player information for a football team. It showcases essential details such as player names, positions, numbers, and nicknames, providing a visually appealing and informative experience for users.

ðŸ’¡ This project was developed as part of my learning journey in **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. The app incorporates various programming concepts, enhances my understanding of data structures, and utilizes modern JavaScript features to create a responsive UI.

## User Stories

- Each player card displays the player's name, position, number, and nickname (if available).
- Players who are captains are highlighted with a "(Captain)" label.
- The app allows filtering players based on their nicknames.
